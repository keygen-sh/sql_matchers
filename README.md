## Installation

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'sql_matchers'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install sql_matchers
```

## Usage

```ruby
it 'should assert query count' do
  expect { User.find_by(id: 1) }.to match_query(count: 1)
end

it 'should assert query matches' do
  expect { 3.times { User.find_by(id: _1 + 1) } }.to(
    match_queries(count: 3) do |queries|
      first, second, third, *rest = queries

      expect(first).to eq %(SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = 1 LIMIT 1)
      expect(second).to eq %(SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = 2 LIMIT 1)
      expect(third).to eq %(SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" = 3 LIMIT 1)
      expect(rest).to be_empty
    end
  )
end

it 'should assert SQL matches' do
  # match_sql will attempt to normalize formatting to prevent false-negatives
  expect(User.where(id: 42).to_sql).to match_sql <<~SQL.squish
    SELECT
      users.*
    FROM
      users
    WHERE
      users.id = 42
  SQL
end
```

## Future

Right now, the gem only supports RSpec, but we're open to pull requests that
extend the functionality to other testing frameworks.

## Supported Rubies

**`sql_matchers` supports Ruby 3.1 and above.** We encourage you to upgrade
if you're on an older version. Ruby 3 provides a lot of great features, like
better pattern matching and a new shorthand hash syntax.

## Is it any good?

Yes.
